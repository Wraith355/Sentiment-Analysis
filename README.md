# Emotion Detection from Text Web Application

A machine learning web application that detects emotions from text input using neural networks. The app classifies text into different emotional categories using a trained deep learning model.

## Description

This application uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques to analyze and classify the emotional content of text input. Built with TensorFlow, Keras, and Streamlit, it provides real-time emotion detection from user-provided text.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Uses NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for text preprocessing.
- **Emotion Classification**: A neural network-based emotion classification system that detects various emotional states from input text.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly interface built using Streamlit that allows for real-time interaction with the app.
- **Real-Time Emotion Detection**: Detects emotions from the provided text input in real-time.
- **Multiple Emotion Categories**: Supports classification of text into various emotional categories like happiness, sadness, anger, etc.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used to build the app.
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning framework used for building and training the emotion detection model.
- **Keras**: High-level neural networks API used to define and train the deep learning model.
- **NLTK**: Toolkit for natural language processing used for text preprocessing.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for creating web applications.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used for various preprocessing tasks.

## Installation

To get started with the application, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository:
